# Memory Structure Documentation

## ðŸ“¸ Core Concept

Every memory in Opa Harry's memorial has **two parts**:

1. **Photo** (Required) - Displayed in the mosaic card
2. **Additional Content** (Optional) - Quote, Audio, or Video (or just a photo with no additional content)

## ðŸŽ¨ Memory Types

### Type: `quote`
- **Photo**: Required - shows in mosaic card
- **Additional Content**: Quote text about Opa Harry
- **Example**: 
  - Photo: Family gathering photo
  - Quote: "Opa Harry always said, 'Family is everything'"

### Type: `audio`
- **Photo**: Required - shows in mosaic card  
- **Additional Content**: Audio recording (story, message, song)
- **Example**:
  - Photo: Opa Harry at the piano
  - Audio: Recording of him playing his favorite song

### Type: `video`
- **Photo**: Required - shows in mosaic card (thumbnail/representative image)
- **Additional Content**: Video clip
- **Example**:

## ðŸ“± Storage Paths

### Firebase Storage Structure:
```
memories/
  â””â”€ {memoryId}/
      â”œâ”€ photo.jpg          (the mosaic card photo)
      â”œâ”€ audio.mp3          (if type='audio')
      â””â”€ video.mp4          (if type='video')
```

### Firestore Document Examples:

**Photo with Quote:**
```json
{
  "id": "mem_123",
  "type": "quote",
  "photoUrl": "https://storage.../memories/mem_123/photo.jpg",
  "typeInput": "Opa Harry was the kindest man I ever knew",
  "submitterName": "Jan",
  "gridPosition": { "row": 5, "col": 12 },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Just a Photo:**
```json
{
  "id": "mem_124",
  "photoUrl": "https://storage.../memories/mem_124/photo.jpg",
  "submitterName": "Maria",
  "gridPosition": { "row": 5, "col": 13 },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}
```
